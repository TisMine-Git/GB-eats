Details: see project spec

1.Implemented a HashMap data structure similar to C++ STL unordered_map.

2.Used A*/DFS to implement Point-to-point router that returns route from a starting point to a destination.

3.Used Simulated Annealing algorithm to implement Delivery optimizer that arranges orders of deliveries to minimize total distance travelled.

4.Implemented Delivery planner that uses all above functions to generate optimized turn by turn directions for delivery.
